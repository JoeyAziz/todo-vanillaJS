> What am I doing?

I love exploring and having hands-on experience with various technologies, and that's why I decided to create this simple to-do web app using vanilla javascript and SCSS.
I have so many great ideas that I want to add to this repo and so I managed the kanban board here (inside projects tab/process) to keep you updated with the process. 
I will contribute to this repo weekly as much as I can and here you can find the live demo for the current working version (https://joeyaziz.github.io/todo-vanillaJS/).

> What am I trying to achieve?
1. Responsiveness using mobile-first design concept.
2. Explore SCSS different features.
3. SVG animation.
4. Realism in UI Design
